            During the internship I participated in the development of the company's internal project with full immersion in the development process. For the first time I worked with Compose

            *"In short, you are good, we are satisfied with your work. I want to note your motivation and involvement, your speed of immersion in new technologies and completing tasks, a clear breakdown of code by commit, good design of pull-requests, quick response to comments, the presence of your own ideas and suggestions. Also noted soft skills, the fact that you didn't hesitate to ask questions not only to mentors, but also to designers and analysts - that's very cool"* - @MyMentor

        - Have a terrible **Hermione Granger complex**
        - I've loved reading since childhood, especially **dystopias and fiction**, but lately I've been drawn to **comic books** in English. 
        - Like everyone else like **Netflix and chill** 
        - When I have time, I dive into any **Action/RPG** game with open world
        - One of the reasons I like being a developer is that I will be able to work remotely and **travel** all the time (hopefully)
